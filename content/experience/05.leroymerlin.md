description: >
  I work on a web application for employees that allows them to study competitor products to help the company remain attractive.

  I started the redesign of this application when I arrived using Nuxt3 and trained my colleagues on this framework. Today, this application is deployed and used in several countries within the company.
  - Developed and maintained a web application using Nuxt3 for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend.
  - Led the migration of the application to TypeScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
  - Implemented GraphQL APIs to enhance data fetching and improve performance.
  - Utilized Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent development and production environments.
  - Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement a design system, enhancing UI consistency across the application.
  - Participated in code reviews and implemented best practices to maintain high code quality and performance.
