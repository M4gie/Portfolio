When I joined the company, I took on the challenge of redesigning an employee web application that helps teams study competitor products and strengthen our market positioning. I initiated the project’s transition to **Nuxt3**, supported my colleagues through this change, and worked closely with **cross-functional teams** to align technical improvements with business needs.  
This application is successfully deployed and actively used across several countries.

Throughout this journey, I developed strong **collaboration and mentoring skills**, guiding teammates through new technologies and fostering a culture of learning. I also honed my ability to **communicate complex ideas**, **solve problems efficiently**, and **adapt to evolving requirements** — ensuring both technical excellence and team cohesion.  

This experience allowed me to combine my passion for **innovation, teamwork, and meaningful impact** on the company’s success.
