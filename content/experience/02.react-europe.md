description: >
  During this 4-month internship as a remote mobile developer at ReactEurope, I primarily worked on migrating the JavaScript code of a mobile application to TypeScript. This transition required a deep understanding of the existing code and the application of advanced TypeScript skills. In parallel, I contributed to the development of new features, thereby enhancing the user experience. This internship provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my TypeScript skills and actively participate in the development of a mobile application within the React environment.
  - Migrated a mobile application codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
  - Developed new features for the mobile application using React Native and Expo.
  - Collaborated with a remote team using Git for version control and AWS for deployment.
  - Gained practical experience in TypeScript and mobile app development in a professional setting.
