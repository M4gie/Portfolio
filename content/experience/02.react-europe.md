During this 4-month remote internship at **ReactEurope**, I worked as a **mobile developer** focused on migrating an existing mobile application from **JavaScript to TypeScript**. This migration required a precise understanding of the existing architecture and the ability to apply advanced TypeScript concepts to improve code quality, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

In parallel, I contributed to the development of new features using **React Native** and **Expo**, enhancing both performance and user experience.

Working remotely with an international team taught me the importance of **clear communication** and **autonomy**. This experience strengthened my technical foundation in TypeScript and mobile development while reinforcing my ability to balance technical precision with user-focused design.
