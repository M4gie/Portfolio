sQuiz.gg is one of my most comprehensive projects, later acquired, and is a web application that allows Twitch streamers to play general knowledge quizzes with their communities. I started working on it during my studies and still maintain it when necessary. Over time, the project has grown into a collaborative platform with a team of volunteers (writers, developers, moderators), partially funded by streamers who support hosting and new feature development. Today, sQuiz.gg has over **150k registered users** and more than **80k general knowledge questions**.

As the user base grew, I monitored performance and reliability with **Datadog**, which helped me identify bottlenecks and improve the overall user experience. The product evolved in a strongly **user-driven** way: feedback from streamers and players directly influenced feature priorities, UX decisions, and technical improvements. Working with a team of volunteers taught me to coordinate profiles with different backgrounds, communicate clearly, and keep the long-term vision aligned with community needs, reinforcing my autonomy, ownership, and user-centric mindset.
