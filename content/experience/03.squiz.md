description: >
  sQuiz.gg is one of my most comprehensive projects (which was later acquired). It is a web application that allows Twitch streamers to play general knowledge quizzes with their community. I started working on it during my studies and now, I continue to maintain it when necessary. The project now has a team of volunteers (writers, developers, moderators), and the hosting and development of certain features are funded by streamers. This project has over 150k registered users and features more than 80k general knowledge questions.
  - Developed and maintained a real-time quiz application using Nuxt for the frontend and Adonis.js for the backend.
  - Implemented WebSocket communication to enable live interactions between streamers and their audiences.
  - Designed and optimized a PostgreSQL database to handle large volumes of user data and quiz questions.
  - Utilized Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent development and production environments.
  - Monitored application performance and reliability using Datadog, leading to improved user experience.
  - Collaborated with a team of volunteers, including writers, developers, and moderators, to enhance the platform and manage content.
