description: >
  I worked at Decathlon in the second-hand sector on a project that was initiated less than a year ago. My role was to develop the frontend part using Svelte technology, allowing Decathlon customers to evaluate the buyback price of their sports equipment and make their retribution once the buyback was completed.

  When I arrived, the project was not yet in production. However, over time, we managed to launch it in more than 11 countries üåç. We also reached one million visitors. This rapid growth is a testament to the positive impact of our initiative, and I am proud to have contributed to the ongoing success of this project.
