I worked at **Decathlon** in the second-hand sector on a project that was initiated less than a year ago. My main mission was to develop the **frontend using Svelte**, enabling customers to evaluate the buyback price of their sports equipment and receive their retribution once the buyback was completed.

When I joined the team, the project was not yet in production. Over time, through strong collaboration with designers, backend developers, and product managers, we successfully launched the platform in **more than 11 countries 🌍**, attracting **over one million visitors**. This growth reflected our shared focus on building a **user-driven product**, where every feature was guided by real customer feedback and usage insights.
