Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to retain access to their lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This feature is powerful and enables various programming patterns.

```js [closureExample.js]{2} meta-info=val
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```
